"A religious group in South Korea has been identified as a coronavirus hotbed, officials say, amid a sharp rise in confirmed cases in the country. The infections among members of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, the Temple of the Tabernacle of the Testimony (Shincheonji) are linked to one woman. The sect in the city of Daegu accounts for 30 of 53 new cases, with officials warning of an unprecedented crisis. South Korea also confirmed its first death from the virus, named Covid-19. The coronavirus, which originated in China's Hubei province, causes pneumonia-like symptoms. China has now seen 2,118 deaths and recorded nearly 75,000 infections. On Thursday, Japan said two of its passengers who contracted the coronavirus on board quarantined cruise ship Diamond Princess had died. The man and the woman were in their 80s. What about the outbreak among sect members? South Korean health officials believe that the infections are linked to a 61-year-old woman who tested positive for the virus earlier this week. The Korean Centre for Disease Control says the woman - who has not been identified - had contact with 166 people, who were asked to self-quarantine. At least 30 of the new Covid-19 infections were on Thursday recorded among sect members in Daegu, a city of about 2.5 million people in the south-east. The Shincheonji, which has been accused of being a cult, said it had now shut down its Daegu branch and that services in other regions would be held online or individually at home. The mayor of the city has described the event as an ""unprecedented crisis"" and urged people in the city to stay indoors. Commanders on a nearby US military base also imposed access restrictions, news agency AFP reported. What is the Shincheonji? What's the overall picture in South Korea? The number of confirmed cases now stands at 104.  New cases were also reported in the capital Seoul and the nearby North Gyeongsang province. Meanwhile, the authorities revealed that a man died on Wednesday from pneumonia believed to have been caused by the coronavirus. The 63-year-old man - who has not been publicly named - died in hospital in the south-eastern city of Cheongdo. He was among 15 people at the hospital who had earlier tested positive for the virus.  The victim had been bedridden for more than 20 years at the hospital, Yonhap news agency reports. What's the latest from the Diamond Princess ship? The ocean liner was carrying 3,700 people in total and passengers who tested negative for the virus began leaving the ship on Wednesday after a 14-day quarantine.  Hundreds have now disembarked from the cruise liner docked in Yokohama. Others are set to leave over the next two days. More than 150 Australian passengers have already arrived in Darwin, where they will begin two weeks of quarantine.  The first batch of people from Hong Kong have also flown back to the city, where they will similarly be quarantined. UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said Britons stranded on the ship would be able to board an evacuation flight home on Friday, as long as they were not showing symptoms of the virus.  Indonesia is also set to repatriate its citizens.  In other developments: And what about China? China reported 114 new deaths on Wednesday but the number of new infections recorded was 394 compared with 1,749 on Tuesday. There are more than 1,000 cases outside China, including on Diamond Princess and in Singapore, South Korea and Hong Kong.   Iran says two people infected with the virus have died in the city of Qom - the first reported deaths in the Middle East.  On Wednesday, Hong Kong said a 70-year-old man with underlying illnesses had become the territory's second fatality.  Japan has three deaths attributed to the virus, while France, the Philippines and Taiwan have each reported one death. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-51572137
"A prisoner at the centre of a coronavirus scare following his extradition from Thailand has admitted drugs charges. Mark Rumble was one of two inmates at HMP Bullingdon in Oxfordshire held in isolation earlier this month. The pair later tested negative for the illness. Rumble, 31, was extradited to the UK in January and tested for Covid-19. Judge Peter Ross said the defendant had been living ""the high life"" in Thailand before his arrest. Oxford Crown Court heard Rumble had been the second in command of a 15-strong crime gang and ""the immediate first lieutenant"" to gang leader Neil Wadley, who was jailed in 2016 for 17 years. The group, which operated in Oxford and Reading, had sourced cocaine from an Albanian organised crime gang and conspired to supply up to 7kg (15lbs) of that drug and 50kg (110lbs) of cannabis, prosecutor Michael Roques said. Rumble went to to Thailand just days before police arrested other members of the gang in 2015. Judge Ross said pictures published in the media had shown Rumble to be ""rather leading the high life whilst away from the jurisdiction"". He said: ""This is a man who, knowing he was sought by authorities, not only absented himself from the jurisdiction, but ensured he remained out of it for a very long time."" Christopher Blake, defending, told the court he had only been able to see his client on Wednesday because the prisoner had been ""at the heart of a coronavirus scare"". Rumble, formally of Didcot, admitted conspiracy to supply cocaine, cannabis and amphetamines, and possession of methoxetamine with intent to supply. He will be sentenced at a later date.

"A fast-moving virus known as the ""new coronavirus"" has infected thousands of Chinese citizens and spread to more than 25 countries. The respiratory infection, which has been given the official name Covid-19, has claimed more than 2,000 lives so far - more than the 774 killed in the 2003 Sars epidemic. The outbreak, originating in the Chinese city of Wuhan, has been declared a global emergency by the World Health Organization (WHO). Here are 10 maps and graphics that will help you understand what is going on. 1. There have been thousands of cases - the majority in China Across China, tens of thousands of people have been infected with the coronavirus, which causes pneumonia-like symptoms. Thousands more are under medical observation. Coronavirus: A visual guide to the outbreak Changes to the way patients were diagnosed briefly caused a spike in the figures, with a huge increase in the number of confirmed cases on 13 February.  The change allowed doctors in Hubei province - the centre of the outbreak - to diagnose Covid-19 and begin treatment before receiving a positive test result for the virus, as long as a medical assessment and a chest scan suggested the patient might be infected. This change was later reversed causing a dip in the number of cases recorded on 20 February.  On both occasions the province's health authorities confirmed they had revised existing data. This suggests many of the cases that caused the spike on 13 February were old cases being re-classified as coronavirus infections rather than new patients. Coronavirus: A visual guide to the outbreak A study of 44,000 cases of Covid-19 by Chinese health officials has found that more than 80% of the cases have been mild, with the sick and elderly most at risk. 4.7% of cases have been critical according to the study by the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention. According to Chinese officials more than 12,000 people have recovered from the virus.  2. Daily deaths have fallen back The number of deaths announced each day has returned to where is was before the recent change in diagnosis.  The change saw the number of daily deaths spike, but figures released by the Chinese authorities show the number has fallen back. Coronavirus has overtaken the 2003 Sars epidemic in both confirmed cases and deaths.  The Sars - severe acute respiratory syndrome - outbreak lasted around eight months and killed 774 people out of around 8,100 confirmed cases. 3. China introduced a number of measures to try to halt the virus's spread Tight restrictions to contain the disease remain in place in China, despite some workers heading back to their jobs last week following an extended Lunar New Year holiday. Authorities have cancelled flights, closed factories and schools and ordered some cities to go into lockdown in a bid to reduce infections. Many companies are opening a selected number of workplaces as well as limiting staff numbers and staggering working hours. Hubei province remains the worst affected, seeing by far the biggest number of cases of the virus as well as most of the deaths. Its capital city of Wuhan, home to 11 million people, remains in virtual lockdown, with its train stations and airports shut and roads sealed. The origins of the new coronavirus have been linked to illegally traded wildlife at Wuhan's seafood market, which sells live animals including bats, rabbits and marmots. However, the exact source of the outbreak has not been identified. Diary of a life in locked-down Wuhan 4.  Two dozen countries have also had cases The WHO declared the crisis a global health emergency on 30 January as a result of the virus's spread outside China. Infections have now been recorded in 27 countries including Japan, Thailand, the US, Canada, France, Germany and the UK. The majority of these cases are in people who had been to Wuhan. The largest outbreak outside China has been on a cruise ship docked in the Japanese port of Yokohama. Two people have died and more than 600 of the 3,700 people on the ship have been diagnosed with the virus - the largest cluster of cases outside China.  So far, there have been only eight other deaths outside mainland China - in Iran, France, Hong Kong, the Philippines, South Korea, Japan and Taiwan. A growing number of countries have advised their citizens to avoid all non-essential travel to China and many have announced screening measures for passengers arriving from the country.  Some countries have also been evacuating their citizens from Wuhan and placing them in quarantine to monitor them for symptoms and avoid contagion. The US has declared the outbreak a public health emergency and the UK has declared it a ""serious and imminent threat"" to public health, announcing new powers to fight its spread. The WHO has warned against closing borders, saying it would accelerate the spread of the virus if travellers started entering countries unofficially. 5. The symptoms are respiratory Coronaviruses are common, and typically cause mild respiratory conditions, such as a cough or runny nose. But some are more serious - such as the deadly Sars and Mers - Middle East respiratory syndrome.  This outbreak - known as Covid-19 - is a new strain that had not been previously identified in humans. It seems to start with a fever, followed by a dry cough and leads to shortness of breath after a week. But in more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.  A report on the early stages of the outbreak by the Lancet medical journal said most patients who died from the virus had pre-existing conditions. Medical researchers and scientists say it is too early to accurately predict how the virus will spread or calculate the death rate, partly due to mild cases remaining untested and unrecorded and a time lag of reporting infections. There is not yet a specific anti-viral treatment for coronavirus, so people with the infection are currently being treated for their symptoms. The existence of coronavirus was first flagged by a Chinese doctor in late December, but he was reprimanded by local police for ""spreading rumours"". Dr Li Wenliang, a 34-year-old ophthalmologist, has since died from the illness. His death was met with an intense outpouring of grief on Chinese social media as well as anger towards Chinese authorities. 6. You can do things to reduce your chances of catching it The WHO is advising people in affected areas to follow standard procedures to reduce the chance of catching the virus. They include hand and respiratory hygiene as well as safe food practices. People are advised to avoid close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections; wash hands regularly, especially after direct contact with ill people or their environment; and avoid unprotected contact with farm or wild animals. Avoiding eating raw or undercooked animal products is also advised. According to the WHO, although it may be possible that people with coronavirus may be infectious before showing significant symptoms, people showing symptoms are, so far, causing the majority of virus spread.  Those with symptoms should practise ""cough etiquette"", including maintaining distance, covering coughs and sneezes with disposable tissues or the inside of an elbow, and washing hands. In China, protective face masks are in widespread use - both among the general population and medical staff. Although virologists are sceptical about their effectiveness against airborne viruses, there is some evidence to suggest the masks can help prevent hand-to-mouth transmissions. Medical advice in China is to change masks regularly - as often as four times a day for medical teams - and Chinese authorities have appealed to other countries to help with supplies. Can wearing masks stop the spread of viruses? 7. If a case is suspected, there are processes to follow The Chinese government has classified the outbreak in the same category as the Sars epidemic.  This means people diagnosed with the virus in the country must be isolated and can be placed in quarantine. Within healthcare facilities, the WHO advises staff to implement enhanced standard infection prevention and control practices, especially in emergency departments. The WHO advises that patients should be assessed quickly and treated for the level of severity of the disease they have - mild, moderate, or severe. It also recommends immediately implementing infection prevention measures. These include staff wearing protective clothing and limiting patient movement around the hospital. In the UK, the Department of Health has declared the new coronavirus as a ""serious and imminent threat"" to public health, giving authorities in England new powers to keep people in quarantine. England's chief medical officer, Professor Chris Whitty, said the UK strategy was focussed on containment and isolation - and that work was under way to work out how to delay any potential outbreak in the UK. Arrowe Park Hospital, on the Wirral, and Kents Hill Park conference centre, in Milton Keynes, have been designated as ""isolation"" facilities in the UK. All but one of the nine people being treated for the coronavirus in the UK have now been discharged from hospital, after twice testing negative for the virus. All 94 people who were being quarantined at Arrowe Park Hospital have also left the site. More than 100 people are still in quarantine in Milton Keynes. British businessman Steve Walsh, one of the nine UK cases of coronavirus, left hospital last week having fully recovered. Mr Walsh contracted coronavirus on a business trip to Singapore and unknowingly passed it on to 11 other people - five of whom then returned to the UK.

"Two Japanese passengers who contracted the new coronavirus on board a cruise ship quarantined in Japan have died, officials say. Both were in their 80s with underlying health conditions. They were being treated in hospitals after being taken off the Diamond Princess last week.  At least 621 people on the ship tested positive for the virus, named Covid-19, the biggest cluster outside China.  Japan has defended its handling of the situation amid criticism. The coronavirus, which originated in China's Hubei province last year, causes pneumonia-like symptoms. Overall, there have now been 2,118 deaths and nearly 75,000 confirmed infections recorded in mainland China. On Thursday, South Korea confirmed its first coronavirus death. Japan's neighbour also reported a sharp rise in virus cases, most of them from a newly identified cluster at a large religious community. What is known about the two Japanese fatalities? The victims were an 87-year-old man and an 84-year-old woman, Japan's health ministry said. The man - from Kanagawa prefecture south of Tokyo - had had bronchial asthma and died from Covid-19.  The woman - from the capital - died from pneumonia believed to be caused by the coronavirus. The victims have not been publicly named. Japan's Health Minister Katsunobu Kato said they had been sent to medical facilities last week after showing symptoms. ""I believe they received the best possible treatment"", he said. What's the latest from the cruise ship? The Diamond Princess was carrying 3,700 people in total and passengers who tested negative for the virus began leaving the ship on Wednesday after a 14-day quarantine.  Hundreds have now disembarked from the cruise liner docked in Yokohama. Others are set to leave over the next two days. More than 150 Australian passengers have already arrived in Darwin, where they will begin two weeks of quarantine.  The first batch of people from Hong Kong have also flown back to the city, where they will similarly be quarantined. UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said Britons stranded on the ship would be able to board an evacuation flight home on Friday, as long as they were not showing symptoms of the virus.  Indonesia is also set to repatriate its citizens.  In other developments: Why is Japan being criticised for its handling of the quarantine? Japanese health expert Kentaro Iwata, professor at the infectious diseases division of Kobe University, visited the Diamond Princess and said the situation on board was ""completely chaotic"". ""The cruise ship was completely inadequate in terms of infection control,"" he said in a widely shared YouTube video which he has since taken offline.  US officials have also said moves to contain the virus ""may not have been sufficient"". But on Thursday, Mr Kato responded to Mr Iwata's criticism, saying authorities had worked hard to deal with a very complicated situation. ""We've been doing our best in the circumstances,"" Mr Kato told Japanese lawmakers. ""Not only our officials at the health ministry but also Self-Defence Forces officials and medical officials are working desperately hard. ""We have specialists of infectious diseases [on the ship], and we get feedback from them about our operation every day, including dividing [the areas inside the ship]."" The health minister stressed that the cruise ship was ""not a well-established place such as a hospital"", and that the authorities ""kept correcting"" various problems on a daily basis. ""We have to examine and learn from this case because we think this is a global issue,"" Mr Kato said. On Wednesday, Japan's National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) released its report, which pointed to ""clear evidence that substantial transmission of COVID-19 had been occurring prior to implementation of quarantine on Diamond Princess 5 February"". ""The decline in the number of confirmed cases, based on reported onset dates, implies that the quarantine intervention was effective in reducing transmission among passengers,"" the report said. What's the latest from China? China has seen a sharp drop in the number of new infections.  There were 394 new confirmed cases and 114 deaths reported on Wednesday, down from 1,749 new cases on Tuesday, the National Health Commission said. There are more than 1,000 cases outside of China, including on Diamond Princess and in Singapore, South Korea and Hong Kong.   Iran says two people infected with the virus have died in the city of Qom - the first reported deaths in the Middle East.  On Wednesday, Hong Kong said a 70-year-old man with underlying illnesses had become the territory's second fatality.  France, Japan, the Philippines and Taiwan have each had one death attributed to the virus. Sharp rise in South Korea South Korea on Thursday announced a jump of 31 confirmed Covid-19 infections - 23 of them from a newly identified cluster at a large religious community. South Korea now has a total of 82 confirmed cases.  The cluster is in the south-western city of Daegu - home to 2.5 million residents - and is believed to be linked to a 61-year-old woman who was confirmed to be infected earlier this week. The Korean Centre for Disease Control said the woman had had contact with 166 people, who were asked to self-quarantine, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reports.  The religious sect known as the Temple of the Tabernacle of the Testimony, which has been accused of being a cult, said it had shut down its Daegu branch and that services in other regions would be held online or individually at home.

"A virus causing severe lung disease that started in China has spread to other countries, including the UK. The coronavirus had infected 74,651 people in China as of 20 February, with 2,120 of them dying. What are the symptoms? It seems to start with a fever, followed by a dry cough.  After a week, it leads to shortness of breath and some patients require hospital treatment. Notably, the infection rarely seems to cause a runny nose or sneezing. The incubation period -  between infection and showing any symptoms - lasts up to 14 days, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). But some researchers say it may be as long as 24 days. And Chinese scientists say some people may be infectious even before their symptoms appear. How deadly is the coronavirus? Based on data from 44,000 patients with this coronavirus, the WHO says: The proportion dying from the disease, which has been named Covid-19, appears low (between 1% and 2%) - but the figures are unreliable. Thousands are still being treated but may go on to die - so the death rate could be higher. But it is also unclear how many mild cases remain unreported - so the death rate could also be lower. To put this it into context, about one billion people catch influenza every year, with between 290,000 and 650,000 deaths. The severity of flu changes every year. Can coronavirus be treated or cured? Right now, treatment relies on the basics - keeping the patient's body going, including breathing support, until their immune system can fight off the virus. However, the work to develop a vaccine is under way and it is hoped there will be human trials before the end of the year. Hospitals are also testing anti-viral drugs to see if they have an impact. How can I protect myself? The WHO says: How fast is it spreading? Thousands of new cases are being reported each day. However, analysts believe the true scale could be 10 times larger than official figures. China, where the outbreak began, has seen a sharp drop in the number of new infections. There were 394 new confirmed cases and 114 deaths reported on Wednesday, down from 1,749 new cases on Tuesday, the National Health Commission said. The WHO says the outbreak, which it has declared a global emergency, can be contained.  But some experts, including a former head of the US Centers for Disease Control, say it could become a pandemic - a global epidemic. With colds and flu tending to spread fastest in the winter, there is hope the turning of the seasons may help stem the outbreak.  School holidays may also help to slow its spread. However, a different strain of coronavirus - Middle East respiratory syndrome - emerged in the summer, in Saudi Arabia, so there's no guarantee warmer weather will halt the outbreak. How did it start? This virus is not really ""new"" - it is just new to humans, having jumped from one species to another. Many of the early cases were linked to the South China Seafood Wholesale Market, in Wuhan.  In China, a lot of people come into close contact with animals harbouring viruses - and the country's dense urban population means the disease can be easily spread. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars), which is also caused by a coronavirus, started off in bats and then infected the civet cat, which in turn passed it on to humans.  The Sars outbreak, which started in China in 2002, killed 774 of the 8,098 people infected. The current virus - one of seven types of coronavirus - does not seem to be mutating so far. But while it appears stable, this is something scientists will be watching closely. Follow James on Twitter.

"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Apple is temporarily closing its 42 stores in mainland China, one of its largest markets, as a new virus spreads rapidly and the death toll there rose to 259 on Saturday. The iPhone maker said in a statement it was closing stores, corporate offices and contact centers in China until Feb. 9 “out of an abundance of caution and based on the latest advice from leading health experts.” “Our thoughts are with the people most immediately affected by the coronavirus and with those working around the clock to study and contain it,” the statement said.Apple’s online store will remain open. China is the company’s third biggest market in terms of sales behind the United States and Europe and it is also where most iPhones and other devices are made. CEO Tim Cook told analysts on Tuesday that uncertainty due to the outbreak was keeping the Cupertino, California-based company from offering more specific guidance about its financial performance in the coming months after announcing results for the holiday shopping season that were far better than investors anticipated.That performance propelled Apple’s stock price to new highs earlier this week, but the escalating uncertainty about the situation in China quickly dampened spirits. Apple shares dropped 4% Friday to finish at $309.51.In a Saturday note, Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives predicted the store closures will have a “negligible” impact on Apple, largely because consumers in mainland China will still be able to buy iPhones and other products through online channels. Even if the shutdown of the brick-and-mortar stores extends throughout the entire month of February, Ives predicted it would lower only lower Apple’s annual iPhone sales in that region by about 3%. Apple doesn’t disclose how many iPhones it sells in China, but the company generated nearly $44 billion in revenue from the country in its last fiscal year. Cook also said the company’s contractors in China have been forced to delay reopening factories that closed for the Lunar New Year holiday.Cook said the company was looking for ways to minimize supply disruptions. Some of its suppliers are in Hubei, the Chinese province at the center of the outbreak that’s been under lockdown for more than a week.",https://apnews.com/Coronavirus/bac0f4b76cf8bfe10204d132c6ddff81
"ALHAMBRA, Calif. (AP) — The rapid spread of a new virus from China has cast a pall across Chinese American communities, with people staying inside whenever possible, wearing medical masks when they must go out and canceling some celebrations for Lunar New Year, China’s biggest holiday.Those actions became the new normal this week, when the count neared 12,000 people infected by a new coronavirus that originated in China and spread to other countries. More than 250 have died in China. The precautions were on display Friday in a string of majority-Asian population cities in Southern California — Alhambra, San Gabriel and Arcadia — that are linked together just east of Los Angeles. “Business is way down. Everybody is staying inside and lots of people are wearing masks,” said Leo Peng at Beyond Services in Alhambra, a normally bustling business where people can notarize documents, get fingerprinted and use other services needed to obtain forms of identification. Peng himself says he has become diligent about washing his hands and is thinking about getting a mask, “although some people say they’re really not necessary.”Sitting just a few feet away at a computer terminal was Cynthia Bao, wearing a bright pink mask.“I never wear a mask, but I’m pregnant, and I don’t want to get the coronavirus or the flu or any virus,” she said. In San Francisco’s Chinatown, Hoa Nguyen and her husband were among the few people wearing masks as they waited at a bus stop carrying bags loaded with fruits and vegetables. “It’s better to be safe than sorry,” she said. “In Chinatown, there’s a higher chance you might come across someone who has traveled to China recently.”While people are taking personal precautions, organizers are going a step further by canceling Lunar New Year celebrations in parts of the U.S. Sponsors of Saturday’s annual festival in Alhambra announced they were postponing it indefinitely. The event normally draws thousands and shuts down the city’s main thoroughfare for blocks, featuring a parade, games, music, food booths and other events. Other cancellations include a Lunar New Year Temple Bazaar this weekend in Flushing, Queens, home to New York City’s largest Chinatown; a Lunar New Year celebration Saturday at a high school in Rockville, Maryland; a Chinese New Year Festival on Saturday at the University of Arizona in Tucson; and festivities Friday in the city of Elk Grove, outside Sacramento.San Francisco still plans to go along with its celebration on Feb. 8, though officials said they are closely monitoring the outbreak. Gregg Orton, national director of the Washington-based National Council of Asian Pacific Americans, said it’s understandable that events are being canceled out of an abundance of caution. “We want to take this seriously but we don’t want to fall back into racism and hysteria at the end of the day,” Orton said. “We’re all in this together.”In Alhambra, many people supported canceling the festival.“I think that’s a good idea until we see that the virus is gone,” said Richard Vu who repairs cellphones at a shop on the edge of the festival’s parade route. He said he’s trying to keep his distance from customers and uses hand sanitizer after handling each phone. He usually wears a mask, too, but forgot it Friday. When he tried to buy another at a pharmacy, he found they were sold out, a common experience that others cited.“They say they won’t have any more until March,” Vu said.Pharmacies in Manhattan’s Chinatown and other neighborhoods also have reported being out of masks.Officials gathered at a hotel in San Gabriel, a city neighboring Alhambra, said it’s important to take precautions but that people should not panic.“At this point, we are not in the same situation as China,” Dr. Munto Davis of the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health told reporters. “We do not have thousands of cases inside the United States.”There are seven cases: three in California, one in Washington state, one in Arizona and two in Chicago. Meanwhile, a main drag in Alhambra that is lined for miles with upscale restaurants, hipster bars and tea houses, was unusually quiet Friday. A sprawling parking lot, a difficult place to find a parking spot on any day, was only half-filled and business was slow at the huge 168 Market, part of a popular Asian chain of grocery stores. People seemed to be heeding the advice of medical professionals, being careful but not panicking while expressing hope that others wouldn’t blame every Asian person for the outbreak.“The racism has been something,” Bao said with disgust. “I sort of get it,” she added. “We’re Chinese, and we don’t know who has been to China and who hasn’t. But you don’t need to make remarks about it.”To which Peng added: “I hope everybody would work together and not discriminate against one group of people.” ___Associated Press reporters Daisy Nguyen in San Francisco and Terry Tang in Phoenix contributed to this story.",https://apnews.com/Coronavirus/c14aa16d2351f6e7a54c267f5772669b
"LONDON (AP) — The coronavirus-enforced suspension of soccer in China has led to Manchester United filling a void in its strike force.Odion Ighalo joined United on loan until the end of the season in May from Shanghai Greenland Shenhua just before the January transfer window closed on Friday night.United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer turned to the former Watford player while  scrambling to find a forward after Marcus Rashford with ruled out with a long-term injury. United had been trying to sign Josh King from Bournemouth but a deal couldn’t be struck.It is three years since Ighalo left England for China after scoring 39 goals in 100 appearances for Watford, with 20 coming in the second-tier Championship. He was African Cup of Nations top scorer last year with five goals in Nigeria’s run to third place.“He will come in and give us an option of a different type of center forward for the short spell he’s staying with us,” Solskjaer said. “A great lad and very professional, he will make the most of his time here.”The 30-year-old  Ighalo , who has also played in Norway, Italy and Spain, initially moved to China in 2017 to join  Changchun Yatai.

"BEIJING (AP) — Meron Mei, a sophomore at Wuhan University in the Chinese city at the heart of a viral outbreak, went back to his home village and started to cough.So he went to the hospital and got checked. Doctors determined it was a common cold, not the new coronavirus, he says, and he returned home. Then a week ago,  he says,  five officers showed up at his house in Xishui County, a two hour drive from Wuhan. They wore masks and wielded blue, gun-shaped thermometers.Now Mei finds himself under constant surveillance by plainclothes police. His doorstep has been posted with a red warning: “Do not approach – patient with suspected pneumonia.” Doctors in gowns, goggles and masks check his temperature three times a day, and the government calls him constantly to monitor his condition — despite tests that  he says show his body  is free of the coronavirus. His phone is constantly checked; its camera has been disabled and his photos deleted. He relayed his story to The Associated Press via messages in English to prevent officers from reading them. “I am in prison,” said Mei, whose story could not be independently verified by the AP. “I’m so angry. I feel physically and mentally exhausted.” As China institutes the largest quarantine in human history, locking down more than 50 million people in the center of the country, those who have recently been to Wuhan are being tracked, monitored, turned away from hotels and placed into isolation at their homes and in makeshift quarantine facilities. The  information available to regular people is uneven.  Uneasy residents have circulated lists of hundreds of people from Wuhan containing sensitive personal information including addresses, phone numbers, national ID numbers, dates of birth and occupations. One list sent by a Shanghai resident to the AP lists 174 people in the city’s Putuo district, including a foreigner, some city natives, many people from other parts of China, and an apartment where the resident lives. The identification numbers were authentic and matched other data on the list, according to a Chinese ID reference tool.“Inside information! Accurate and reliable!” said one post sharing the list, in a screenshot shared with the AP. “Putuo friends please pay attention, the people listed here have all gone to Wuhan, and they aren’t allowed into hospitals, so they’re being forcibly isolated at home! Neighbors, don’t go outdoors under any circumstances!”During the past decade, the Chinese government crafted a rigorous system of social control, which it calls “stability maintenance.” Through methods high-tech and low, from face-scanning cameras to neighborhood informants to household registration, Beijing keeps track of its 1.4 billion citizens, managing them via community-level officials.Such monitoring doesn’t typically bother most people in China. Usually only political dissidents or minorities are subject to overt state control. But in times of extraordinary stress, such as the virus outbreak, these systems swing into action nationwide. On Jan. 25, an extraordinary televised meeting of the Politburo Standing Committee, China’s ruling inner circle of power, ordered officials to carry out “prevention and control work” with special emphasis on “monitoring, screening and warning.” Since then, millions of local officials and officers have mobilized to monitor, screen and warn — and restrict, to varying degrees — in a governance approach that Beijing calls “blanket-style tracking.”“We must effectively manage people from Wuhan according to the principles of ‘tracking people, registering them, community management, inspecting them at their door, mass transfers, treat abnormalities,’” Li Bin, deputy director of the Chinese National Health Commission, said at a news conference the next day.Officials say — and some experts agree — that the stringent measures are necessary. “This epidemic is spreading quite quickly, which presents challenges and is putting pressure on our control and prevention work,” said Ma Xiaowei, director of the Chinese National Health Commission. “The country has adopted more powerful measures, which should be able to control the epidemic at a lower cost and faster speed.”A woman who works in education in Wuhan said she had been back in her hometown in China’s Inner Mongolia region for nearly two weeks when friends and relatives forwarded her an Excel sheet that contained not just her name but her ID number, address, and occupation. At first, she said, she felt shock, then fury.“It listed a bunch of people in the whole city who had come back from Wuhan,” said the woman, Na. Like many Chinese, she gave only her last name so she could speak openly on a sensitive topic. Police are vigilant about cracking down on information spread through unofficial channels, and many people are often hesitant to speak to the foreign press.“I was so angry,” Na said. “This could affect me later in life.”Unlike Mei, Na’s hometown is more than 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) from Wuhan, and she wasn’t confined to her home. But Na said she began to receive calls from the police, community officials and a newly established epidemic prevention center. Because government departments often fail to share or coordinate data collection, many calling Na asked the same questions. On the first day, she said,  she got a dozen calls , possibly more, asking a slew of questions: Where are you? When are you going home? Who’d you come into contact with?“It’s so bothersome,” she said. “I made it clear that I didn’t want my personal information leaked.”Others upset at leaks took to Weibo, a Chinese social media platform, and demanded to know what was going on. Most posts were deleted, but the censors left up a post by Cui Baoqiu, the vice president of Chinese cellphone maker Xiaomi, who criticized the leaks for stigmatizing people from Wuhan.“Sick people are not criminals,” Cui said. “This data must be managed by a few people in the government. They need to tighten to their controls.”Whether the leaks were intentional is unclear. Various government departments gather reams of data from cameras, cellphones, and social media, as well as through transportation records and queries from health and security officials. In one case, Nick, who asked to be identified by only his English name, said he had merely driven through Wuhan but later found his name on a leaked list. In other cases, people were told to report on anyone suspected of having gone to Wuhan by ringing a hotline. A woman who answered a hotline for Baoshu, a village in Fujian province, confirmed they were offering a 1200 RMB ($173) reward for information. And in  a news conference Thursday, a China State Railway Group representative said it is providing passenger data to the government. Many of the more than 9,600 confirmed cases are in Wuhan and surrounding cities in Hubei province. Virtually the entire province was locked down last week. But even Wuhan natives who slipped out before the trains and planes stopped running are finding there’s no escape.An IT worker from Wuhan who also asked only to be identified by his English name, Andy, to protect his family’s privacy, was sightseeing in Beijing with his wife and two children when he heard the government was closing off his hometown. The family went to Nanjing, a city near China’s coast, but the Intercontinental Hotel turned them away after seeing their national ID cards, which include their Wuhan addresses. Andy finally found a room at the five-star Shangri-La hotel and settled in, planning to stay until it was safe to go back home.On Monday, reception called: Police were kicking them out. It didn’t matter that Andy’s family hadn’t been in Wuhan for more than a week, or that they’d been wearing masks for nearly two. Everyone from Wuhan was being ordered to stay at an isolated Home Inn for 14 days.When they saw their room at the new hostel, Andy panicked: it was drafty. He stuffed wet towels in the cavity underneath his door, but worried it was futile since doors were opened for meals. He was awake until 2 a.m., fretting over his two young children and imagining potentially virus-filled air from the hallways, swirling into their room.Andy says he “totally understands” and “trusts” the government, and appreciates the hard work of doctors and nurses on the front lines. He’s grateful, but he can’t stop worrying.“I understand that in such a big country you don’t want this to spread further,” he said. “What I can’t accept is, what about my children? Who’s going to guarantee our safety?” ",https://apnews.com/Coronavirus/7f7336d2ed099936bd59bf8cb7f43756
"A roundup of some of the most popular but completely untrue stories and visuals of the week. None of these are legit, even though they were shared widely on social media. The Associated Press checked them out. Here are the real facts:___CLAIM: Chlorine dioxide will help get rid of the new virus from China. THE FACTS: As news spread about the new coronavirus outbreak, social media accounts began promoting the idea that drinking chlorine dioxide or using related products with names like Miracle Mineral Solution — or MMS — would help wipe out the virus. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration warns against ingesting the bleaching agent. “We understand people are concerned about the spread of the novel coronavirus and we urge people to talk to their health care provider about treatment options, as well as follow advice from other federal agencies about how to prevent the spread of this illness,” the FDA said in a statement to The Associated Press. Social media users began circulating the false claim on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube shortly after the first case of the virus was reported in the U.S. By Friday, virus had infected almost 10,000 people globally in just two months, with more than 200 deaths in China. Chlorine dioxide has been falsely touted by fringe groups online as a “miracle” cure for autism. The FDA has been warning against drinking chlorine dioxide since 2010 after the agency received several reports of consumers drinking products containing the chemical. The agency warns that it can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and symptoms of severe dehydration. ___CLAIM: FEMA proposes “martial law to contain coronavirus” THE FACTS: Officials with the Federal Emergency Management Agency confirmed that there are no plans to enact martial law in the U.S. In recent days, a false story circulated on social media claiming that FEMA was proposing martial law to contain the respiratory illness spreading around the world. Martial law would transfer power to the military. “This article is not true,” FEMA said in an email sent Tuesday to The Associated Press, adding that they have not advocated for martial law. The false claims about martial law have circulated on Facebook since Jan. 23. “Acting FEMA Director Pete Gaynor on Wednesday offered President Trump a startling solution, Martial Law in the United States, to prevent the spread of a lethal Chinese Coronavirus that infected hundreds and killed at least 17 people in the Communist nation,” the post said. False posts also circulated on Twitter. “Those who are ‘awake’ and aware completely understand the dormant plans for martial law and widespread FEMA detention camps in America,” a Twitter user falsely claimed.___CLAIM: Image shows the first building of Huoshenshan Hospital in the Chinese city of Wuhan constructed in just 16 hours and completed Monday.THE FACTS: Chinese state media shared an image Monday that circulated widely on Twitter, implying that it showed a hospital constructed in just 16 hours to deal with thousands of new patients who have contracted the new virus from China. The photo, which shows a building with large windows in front with a white staircase at the side, is a stock image of a prefabricated office sold from China. The image is used regularly on sites of businesses that sell prefabricated homes, offices or hotel space. The Associated Press obtained photos of crews working to construct Huoshenshan Hospital on Tuesday.___CLAIM: 14 states have no paper ballot record of your vote. THE FACTS: For the 2020 elections only one state, Louisiana, will not keep a paper ballot record of any votes. Eight other states rely on a mixed system, where some counties will keep a paper record of ballots and others will not. Democratic presidential candidate Rep. Tulsi Gabbard posted a video Wednesday on her social media account, in which she misleadingly claimed that 14 states have no paper ballot record of votes cast. Gabbard called it the “greatest threat to our democracy,” warning that it could entirely shape the results of the 2020 election. Her comments, which were not fully accurate, asked people to share the claim on Twitter and Facebook. The information Gabbard provided was outdated and doesn’t provide a full picture of how voters’ ballots will be recorded in the upcoming election. Her campaign did not respond to a request for comment by the AP. States and counties around the country record votes differently. During the 2018 election, there were 14 states where voters might have gone to the polls and cast votes that weren’t backed up on paper. That’s been whittled down to nine states heading into the 2020 election. Currently only one state — Louisiana — keeps no paper trail of votes at all. Counties in eight states — Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, New Jersey, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas — use a hybrid system that may or may not document the votes on paper, said Warren Stewart, a data analyst at Verified Voting, which tracks the election systems counties across the country use. “Many states have a variety of different systems in different counties,” Stewart said. In those states, some counties do not produce paper receipts of votes. In the case of New Jersey, for example, only one county records votes by paper. In Oklahoma, all counties use a paper ballot record system except for voters with disabilities who might cast a vote on an electronic system. It’s worth noting that there is no federal regulation requiring paper ballot backups. Gabbard introduced legislation last year that would provide states with funding to ensure votes are recorded on paper. Experts have warned that systems without a paper ballot backup could be hacked in the election. Last year, an analysis by the Brennan Center of Justice at New York University’s School of Law found that as many as 12 percent of voters might cast a ballot without a paper backup in the 2020 election.___CLAIM: Video captured fatal crash of helicopter carrying Kobe Bryant.THE FACTS: The video shows a helicopter crash in the United Arab Emirates in December 2018. On Jan. 26, NBA legend Kobe Bryant, his daughter and seven others were killed when their helicopter crashed in Calabasas, California. Shortly after the crash, video showing a helicopter going into a tailspin in rugged terrain and then crashing into a canyon began circulating on social media, described as showing the crash of Bryant’s helicopter. One tweet circulating the video with the comment, “R.I.P @kobebryant died videos,” had nearly 3 million views by Monday afternoon. The video actually shows the Dec. 29, 2018, crash of a rescue helicopter in Ras al-Khaimah, in the northeastern region of the United Arab Emirates. All four crew members died in the crash. According to AP reporting, the Augusta 139 helicopter crashed near the world’s longest zipline at UAE’s highest mountain, Jebel Jais, in Ras al-Khaimah. A number of media outlets and social media accounts published video at the time of the 2018 helicopter crash, capturing it from various angles. ___This is part of The Associated Press’ ongoing effort to fact-check misinformation that is shared widely online, including work with Facebook to identify and reduce the circulation of false stories on the platform.___ Find all AP Fact Checks here: https://apnews.com/APFactCheck___ Follow @APFactCheck on Twitter: https://twitter.com/APFactCheck",https://apnews.com/Coronavirus/4e654fb27cb4bbdc9618921eaeeabe40
"NEW HAVEN, Conn.

"The start of the League of Legends Pacific Championship Series season has been delayed because of the outbreak of the coronavirus. The season was set to start on Feb. 8, and organizers did not provide a new start date. Earlier this week, the Legends Pro League in China also indefinitely postponed its Week 2 play. As of Wednesday, 132 people had died and another 6,000 people in mainland China were confirmed to have the coronavirus, CNN reported. Because of the teams’ proximity to China, organizers announced Wednesday on Facebook that they had put play on hold. “In light of the novel coronavirus outbreak and its development in our region, we have decided to postpone the start of the PCS in the interest of the safety and well-being of our players and teams,” the statement read. “Amongst other considerations, several members of the operational staff, as well as team(s) staff have been affected by travel restrictions that have been implemented to mitigate the spread of the virus. To all fans, we apologize for this delay and will be sharing any updates on the schedule as soon as we can. Please stay safe and protected.” The nine-team PCS has three franchises each in Taiwan and Hong Kong, as well as single teams in Singapore, Thailand and the Philippines.

"LONDON, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Here are some key features of viruses and the new coronavirus that was identified in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in December and is causing an outbreak of disease in China and beyond. * Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that get their name from what they look like under a microscope - they are spherical and their surfaces are covered with “crown”-like spikes. * Coronavirus infections have a wide range of symptoms, including fever, coughing, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. Mild cases can cause cold-like symptoms, while severe cases can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory illness, kidney failure and death. * Like other coronaviruses, the newly identified China coronavirus is being transmitted from person-to-person via droplets when an infected person breathes out, coughs or sneezes. It can also spread via contaminated surfaces such as door handles or railings. * Infection with the newly identified virus has an incubation period of between one and 14 days, and there are limited accounts that it may also be spreading before symptoms show. * Infectious disease and virus specialists say the scale of the current outbreak now points to “self-sustaining” human-to-human transmission. They estimate that each infected person is infecting, on average, two to three more people. * Animal viruses can mutate or combine with other viruses to create new strains capable of being passed to people. Scientists say the new coronavirus originated in bats and then passed to humans, possibly via an intermediary animal species. * Genetic data suggest the new coronavirus is the result of viral recombination - a process where more than one virus infects the same cell at the same time and creates a “recombinant” virus strain.

"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia is ready to bring forward a meeting of OPEC and its allies to February from March to address a possible hit to global oil demand from coronavirus, Russia’s energy minister said on Friday. FILE PHOTO: The logo of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) sits outside its headquarters ahead of the OPEC and NON-OPEC meeting, Austria December 6, 2019. REUTERS/Leonhard FoegerAlexander Novak said he was in discussions with OPEC leader Saudi Arabia and added that the oil-producing nations would need several more days to assess the impact and decide on the date of the meeting. A coronavirus outbreak in China could cut oil demand by more than 250,000 barrels per day (bpd) in the first quarter of this year and drag on oil prices already beleaguered by oversupply, analysts and traders say. “We can meet earlier, this is not a problem at all,” Novak was quoted by Russian agency RIA as saying. “We have discussed it with the Saudi (energy) minister several times already ... Yesterday, we spoke for an hour, today for half an hour. We are discussing it very seriously,” Interfax quoted Novak as saying. “In principle, we are ready to quickly react to such things. We need to assess the situation and continue to monitor for a few more days,” he was quoted by Interfax while adding it was too early to say if Russia was prepared to deepen output cuts.

Hubei province was not included, given the travel ban introduced by Chinese authorities in late January.The researchers assessed each African country's capacity to detect and respond to cases based on two World Health Organization indicators: preparedness -- the functional capacity to manage emerging epidemics -- and vulnerability -- the ability to manage emerging epidemics based on demographic, environmental, socioeconomic and political conditions. They grouped African countries at risk of importing cases by the Chinese provinces estimated to contribute most to their risk.Egypt, Algeria and South Africa were shown as having the highest risk of importing a COVID-19 case from China, but had moderate to high preparedness and low vulnerability.

Increased resources, surveillance and capacity building should be urgently prioritized in African countries with moderate risk of importing cases of COVID-19, the authors noted.""It is essential to train, equip, and strengthen the diagnostic capacities of hospital laboratories close to infectious disease and emergency departments to reduce the time to deliver results, manage confirmed cases and contacts more rapidly and preserve strict infection control measures,"" Colizza said.

Of course, what is stupid as opposed simply to committing an error or making a mistake? Is cognitive dissonance, that is, actions known to be harmful or dangerous, such as smoking or taking risks that are foolish, simply an extension of stupidity?

For the United States, for understandable reasons, World War II produced arrogance and this sense of superiority.

That achievement led to an arrogance and sense of superiority, as well as an unshakeable belief in the righteousness of democracy and its universal appeal.That would lead to disastrous and some stupid decisions. For the first two decades of the Cold War, America acted often with impunity in overthrowing or attempting to overthrow regimes antithetical to democracy, from Latin America to Iran.
